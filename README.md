# Solar-Simulation #

This is a solar system simulation of eight celestial bodies over a year time.
The motion of the bodies are governed by the laws of gravity,
which gives rise to a number of differential equations.

To solve these ordinary differential equations, three solvers are implemented:
  - Euler's method
  - Verlet method
  - 4th-order Runge-Kutta method

Besides that, there is a simple 2D graphical representation of the bodies moving.
A screenshot of this is below, it was created using JavaFX.
